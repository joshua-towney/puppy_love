# Puppy Love

I have created a CRUD app which is basically Tinder for Dogs. You need to be logged in to be able to add new entries or view/add comments. 

To log in, use either of the following accounts:

email: woof@bark.com
password: walkies
email: treats@yesplease.com
password: give

Alternatively, you can create your own login account.

Only the user who created the entry will be able to edit or delete it. 

I would love to ba able to add a matching option to this in the future which can display 'It's a match!' with a picture of the two dogs if they liked each others profiles.

## Play around with the app here

to be determined


### Languages used

RUBY, CSS and HTML.



### Obstacles

One big obstacle which took a whle to work out had to do with user entries. Apostropies could not be used for comments and any dog data as it broke the sql entry for the database. 

When editing details, a photo needs to be uploaded everytime. anything requiring text will input empty data if nothing is entered. I would have liked it to used whatever was already on file if nothing was entered. I have madee al fields required as a work around for now.
